# Using PlantGen from your own code

PlantGen is a Rust library (`crates/plantgen`) and a command-line tool
(`plantc`). This page is for developers who want plants in their own
project: one at a time, or many distinct plants of a species at once.

## The stable entry point: `plantgen::api`

Every module of the crate is public, because PlantLab, `plantc` and
Project After reach into them, and they change whenever the generator
does. `plantgen::api` is the part that holds still: its items keep their
names, arguments and meaning until `api::API_VERSION` goes up, and it goes
up only when one of them changes. Build on it, not on the other modules.

What an item returns can still change in its bytes when
`GENERATOR_REVISION` goes up, as every drawing does: plants get better.
The same species, revision, options and seed give the same bytes on every
machine.

Add PlantGen to `Cargo.toml`, pinned to a revision:

```toml
[dependencies]
plantgen = { git = "https://github.com/jferments/plantgen", rev = "<commit>" }
```

One `Generator` per species does everything. Making one reads the
species' spec and draws its organs' textures once; every plant grown from
it after shares them, so keep it for as many plants as you want.

```rust
use plantgen::api::{Generator, Options, Variants};

fn main() -> Result<(), plantgen::api::Error> {
    // Every built-in species, by id.
    for id in plantgen::api::species() {
        println!("{id}");
    }

    // Yarrow, drawn as its package draws it.
    let yarrow = Generator::new("achillea-millefolium", &Options::default())?;

    // One plant: seed 1 in its typical setting at its oldest age, as glTF
    // binary files (one per level of detail) and an index.
    let plant = yarrow.grow(1)?;
    let files = yarrow.export(&plant, &Default::default())?;
    plantgen::export::write(&files, "exports".as_ref())?;

    // Fifty distinct yarrows, written as they are drawn, on every core.
    let set = yarrow.write_variants(&Variants::count(50), "yarrows".as_ref())?;
    println!("{} plants, listed in yarrows/variants.json", set.plants.len());
    Ok(())
}
```

| Item | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `api::species()` | The ids of the built-in species |
| `Generator::new(id, &options)` | A built-in species |
| `Generator::of(&spec, &options)` | A spec of your own (`PlantSpec::from_json`), grown on its taxa's program |
| `Generator::of_in(&spec, library, &options)` | The same, from your own folder of species (`Library::from_dir`) |
| `generator.grow(seed)` | One plant in its typical setting at its oldest age |
| `generator.grow_in(environment, seed, age)` | One plant in `open`, `edge`, `interior` or `suppressed`, at any age it grows to |
| `generator.export(&plant, &settings)` | glTF binary files, one per level of detail, and their index |
| `generator.package(out)` | The species' content-addressed package, as After loads it |
| `generator.write_variants(&variants, out)` | Many plants, each written as soon as it is drawn, and `variants.json` |

`Options` chooses the quality (`STANDARD`, as packages are built, or
`DRAFT`) and the day of the year seasoned organs show. `Settings` chooses
compression (`None`, `Quantize`, `Meshopt`), which attributes to keep and
a triangle or byte budget, as `plantc export`'s flags do. Start from
`Options::default()`, `Settings::default()` and `Variants::count(n)` and
set the fields you choose.

## Seeds and variants

Any seed grows a plant. Seed `n` is the same plant whether 5 plants or
5,000 are made beside it, so you can make more later and keep the ones you
have. The seeds a species' spec lists (`variants.seeds`, 1 always among
them) are the plants its package keeps, and seed 1 is the typical plant.
Other seeds draw the plant's parameters across the spreads its characters
give (its height, branching and the like) by the seed alone, and grow
their own branching, leaves and flowers.

A set lists each plant's seed, size (height, crown, stem diameter, leaf
area), files, bytes and triangles per level, and a fingerprint of its
bytes; `duplicates` names any seed drawn exactly as an earlier one.

## From the command line

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/plantc variants achillea-millefolium --count 50
./target/release/plantc variants pseudotsuga-menziesii --count 20 --age 30 \
    --compress meshopt --out firs
```

The first writes 50 yarrows into `variants/achillea-millefolium/`: for
each, `STEM-lod0.glb` to `STEM-lod3.glb` and `STEM.json`, where STEM is
`<species>-<environment>-<seed>-<age>y`, and `variants.json` listing them.
`plantc help` lists every flag: `--first-seed`, `--env`, `--age`, `--day`,
`--quality`, `--threads`, and `plantc export`'s compression, attribute and
budget flags.

Measured on a 4-core cloud machine (2026-11-01): 6 yarrows at 6 years in
7 s; 4 Douglas-firs at 60 years in 82 s.

The files are glTF 2.0 that need no PlantGen code. Uncompressed and
quantized files open in Blender, Godot, Unity (glTFast) and three.js;
`--compress meshopt` files need a viewer with meshopt decoding, such as
three.js. Nearest levels are drawn at full detail, which for a flowering
herb or an old tree is a lot of triangles: use `--compress` and the
farther levels, or a budget, for real-time scenes.
