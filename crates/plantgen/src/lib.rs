//! Procedural plants for Project After.
//!
//! A species is data (a [`spec::PlantSpec`]); its form comes from a plant
//! program written in an open L-system language ([`lsys`]). The compiler
//! grows each variant once, from seed to old age, inside a synthetic
//! neighbourhood, and keeps a [`graph::PlantGraph`] at each keyframe age.
//! Meshes, level-of-detail chains and impostors are baked from those graphs
//! ([`mesh`], [`raster`], [`impostor`]), with organ cards cut out by
//! templates drawn from the species' looks ([`looks`], [`templates`]), into
//! a content-addressed `.afterplant` package ([`package`]). Fleshy bodies,
//! the stems of cacti and other succulents, are meshed by [`body`], and
//! their spines grow per areole from a pattern per species ([`spines`]).
//! The textures of the ground between plants (litter, moss, grass, soil,
//! sand, gravel and rock) are drawn here too ([`ground`]).
//!
//! Everything here is engine-independent and deterministic: the same spec,
//! generator revision and seed give bit-identical output on every machine,
//! because every random draw is a pure function of lineage identities
//! ([`rng`]) and every transcendental function goes through `libm`
//! ([`math`]).

/// Revision of the generator as a whole: the L-system engine, its tools and
/// the bakers. Bump it whenever output for an unchanged spec changes; it is
/// part of every package key. 3: cluster cards of the far levels gained
/// upright cards, so far crowns show from the side. 4: cluster cards cover
/// what their organs cover, no more, and keep the organs' proportions, so
/// far levels are not denser than near ones. 5: leaf, blade and frond
/// cards bend where they are drawn one per organ (plant forms F2), which
/// changes the impostors and the atlas records. 6: flowers, fruit and cones
/// drawn as solids on the nearest level (F3). 7: every broadleaf package
/// gains the thorn organ type (F5). 8: organ types with part meshes
/// (`crate::parts`, plant roadmap P4) keep their cards on level 0, listed
/// as sites, instead of being drawn solid into its wood mesh, and the
/// package stores their part meshes. 9: needle sprays are solid shoots on
/// the nearest level (`crate::shoots`), and each part mesh stores its span
/// (`APPARTS2`).
